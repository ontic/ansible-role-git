## Installation

We strongly suggest installing this role using [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) so that any dependencies
will get resolved and downloaded automatically. However, we've listed a few other alternatives.

### 1.1 Downloading

Download the project files as a `.zip` archive, extracting them into your `./roles/` directory.

### 1.2 Cloning

Clone the project it into your `./roles/` directory.

### 1.3 Ansible Galaxy

The easiest way to install this module is via the command line:

```
$ ansible-galaxy install ontic.git
```

If you have multiple roles to install, the ansible-galaxy CLI can be fed a `requirements.yml` file.

```yml
- src: ontic.git
```

```
$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively you could download the source by setting the repository in your `requirements.yml` file:

```yml
- src: git+https://github.com/ontic/ansible-role-git.git
  version: master
  name: ontic.git
```

  hosts: web_servers
  roles:
    - { role: ontic.git }
```
